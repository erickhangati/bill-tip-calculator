![Design preview for the Bill / Tip Calculator App Challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor. We were supposed to build a Bill / Tip Calculator App.

## How it works

The app needs 3 entries: bill amount, tip and the number of people to split the bill.

The user can enter the total bill amount, then pick a tip option which will be a percentage of the bill or enter a custom tip amount, and finally enter the number of people for the app to splitt the bill.

The app also has client side validations on the inputs.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS (Grid, Flexbox, SASS)
3. Vanilla JavaScript
